# LaTeX Beamer Theme

This beamer theme is developed in analogy to [Material Design](https://material.io/design/).

## Usage

Have the files in the directory or in your texmf tree, than use:

```latex
\usetheme{Mulliken}
```

The theme uses a combination of two standard inner themes (`rounded` and `rectangles`),
its own color scheme (available separately by `\usecolorscheme{Mulliken}`)
and an outer theme created from the mini frame theme (available separately by `\useouterscheme[subsections=<bool>]{Mulliken}`).
